## problems faced
    -   Navbar
        1.  At the time of responsiveness when user opens the navbar using icon then the width of whole header gets increased.So to resolve this problem used z-index and box shadow property for showing effects to end used rather than making it hovered separately 
        2.  There is a common problem when the navbar of bootstrap is used .The problem is once user clicks on link of navbar still the navbar is visible .So to encounter this the class "show" from  #navbarText div is removed when end user clicks on link

    - glass effect at book-food section  
        -   While decided to use a glass effect in front end started to work on the things with the help of youtube but the effects doesn't fits properly So for this used a reference video from youtube
